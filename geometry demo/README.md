This project is lab 4 of the BU RISE Data Science Practicum, focusing on building a minimal Python package named geometry_demo that defines a clean and extensible interface for geometric shapes. The package includes an abstract Shape base class and concrete implementations for Rectangle and Triangle, each with methods to compute area and perimeter. As part of the objectives, the project was scaffolded with a modular structure and clean public API. A small test suite was written using pytest to verify the correctness of the shape calculations, and the package was installed in editable mode to ensure it could be successfully imported and used from other scripts. This lab reinforces foundational Python packaging practices, test-driven development, and object-oriented design.
